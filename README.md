# Lab2: Geo-tagged tweet collection and visualization

## Part 1:  Purpose of this research 
The maps capture the tweets distrubition across the US, and the maps show the difference between the tiwtter usage (number of new tweets created) between two different time period. Therefore, there were no limitation for the types of tweets contents, but rather the data collection time was different for the two maps. 

## Part 2: The difference between the maps
The data for the first map (period 1) was retrieved after 10pm PST, whereas the data for the second map (period 2) was retrieved at 2pm PST. From the two maps, each dot represents one tweet. We can clearly see that there are less dots in the map 1 then the map 2, which indicates that there are less people posting tweets during period 1. In period 2, there are twice as much new tweets as in period 1. During period one, it is after 10 pm in the west coast, and 2 am in the east coast. It is possible that the majority of the population was sleeping and not using their phone or other device with acess to Twitter. However, during period 2, it was 2 pm at the west coast and 6 pm at the east coast. People were taking a break from work or school. Most important, most people were not sleeping. Therefore, there were more tweets during period 2 that period 1.

## Part 3: The difference between the contexts
